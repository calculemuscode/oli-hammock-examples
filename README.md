This project contains some examples of using the OLI Hammock to make basic OLI embedded activities with custom
grading logic. They are more-or-less ordered here from least to most complicated.

 - `evenodd` - Extremely bare-bones implementation, no hints or styling. Javascript.
 - `names` - Name entry with some formatting logic, uses oli-widgets for styling. Javascript.
 - `binary` - Demonstrates the use of a dynamically-generated question spec. Javascript.
 - `checkrange` - Demonstrates use of a special-purpose parser. Typescript.
 - `prose` - Calls an external API (Lightside) for one of the grading. Typescript.
